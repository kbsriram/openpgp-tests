invalid-signed-subkey.pkr is a public key with two subkeys. One is a
certification subkey, and one is an encryption subkey.

You should accept the certification subkey (signed by the primary
key), but not the encryption subkey (signed by the certification
subkey.)

You might expect that because there's a valid chain of signatures to
the primary key, the encryption subkey should be accepted. However,
binding signatures and userid signatures must be made by the
primary key.

Of course, as a consequence you must not be able to encrypt messages
for this recipient.
