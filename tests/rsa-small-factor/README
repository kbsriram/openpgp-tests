rsa-small-factor.pkr contains RSA keys with a modulus that has a very
small factor for the modulus (one factor is 101). Such keys are
easily broken and should not be accepted.

I've also provided the secret key (rsa-small-factor.skr) if you find
it useful - passphrase "test"

http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-89/SP-800-89_November2006.pdf
has some useful recommendations.
