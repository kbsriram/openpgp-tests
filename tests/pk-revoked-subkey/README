revoked-subkey.pkr has two encryption subkeys. Both encryption subkeys
have been revoked, and your implementation must detect and not use any
of them (and therefore, must not encrypt any messages for this
recipient.)

One of the subkeys has a signature that is newer than the revoked
signature. Revocations are permanent, and cannot be undone by newer
signatures, so you must still not use this subkey.
