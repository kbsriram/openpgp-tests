invalid-signing-subkey.pkr is a public key with two signing subkeys,
but one has a missing embedded signature while the other has an an
invalid embedded signature.

Your implementation must reject signatures created by either
subkey. subkey1-signed.asc and subkey2-signed.asc are two sample
messages signed by these subkeys. Make sure your implementation
rejects both signatures.
