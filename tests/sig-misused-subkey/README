misused-subkey.pkr contains a primary key and an encryption
subkey.

hello.txt.sig is a detached signature that provides a signature for
the file hello.txt, but is signed with the encryption subkey rather
than a signing key. Implementations should reject the signature.

By contrast, hello-good.txt.sig is a good signature for hello.txt
(signed by the primary key which is also flagged as usable for
signing.)
