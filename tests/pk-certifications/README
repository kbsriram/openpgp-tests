This test checks that certifications (related to OpenPGP's web of
trust) are correctly handled.  First read a-certifier.pkr and
b-certifier.pkr. Then import target.pkr, which contains two userids.

You should detect a-certifier as having revoked one of the userids,
and having a bad signature on the other. b-certifier should only
certify one of the userids.
